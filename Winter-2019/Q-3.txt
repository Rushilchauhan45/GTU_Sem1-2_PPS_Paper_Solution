Q.3 (a) Explain Different Types of Constants.

Integer Constants: Whole numbers (e.g., 1, 100).
Floating-Point Constants: Decimal numbers (e.g., 1.5, 3.14).
Character Constants: Single character enclosed in quotes (e.g., 'A').
String Constants: Group of characters (e.g., "Hello").

Q.3 (b) Define Algorithm and Explain Symbols Used in Flowchart.

Algorithm: Step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

Symbols:
--------
Oval: Start/End
Rectangle: Process
Diamond: Decision
Arrow: Flow of Control

Q.3 (c) Program to Check Last Digit is Even or Odd

#include <stdio.h>

void main() 
{
    int num;
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    if ((num % 10) % 2 == 0)
    {
            printf("Last digit is Even\n");
    }
    else
    {
            printf("Last digit is Odd\n");
    }
    
}//end of void main

Q.3 (A)Explain getch().gets(),getchar().

getch(): Reads a single character from the keyboard without echoing it on the screen.

getchar(): Reads a single character from the standard input (keyboard) and echoes it on the screen.

gets(): Reads an entire line of text (string) from the standard input until a newline (\n) is encountered. (Note: gets() is unsafe and deprecated in modern C.)

Q.3 (b) List out the operators used in C language and explain any three with example.

[1]Arithmetic Operators: Used to perform basic arithmetic operations.
[2]Relational Operators: Used to compare two values.
[3]Logical Operators: Used to perform logical operations.
[4]Bitwise Operators: Used to perform bit-level operations.
[5]Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables.
[6]Increment/Decrement Operators: Used to increase or decrease the [7]value of a variable.
[8]Conditional (Ternary) Operator: Used for conditional expressions.

Explanation:
-------------
[1]Arithmetic Operators: Used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

Code:
-----
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a = 10, b = 5;
    printf("Addition: %d\n", a + b);     // Output: 15
    printf("Subtraction: %d\n", a - b);  // Output: 5
    printf("Multiplication: %d\n", a * b); // Output: 50
    printf("Division: %d\n", a / b);     // Output: 2
    printf("Modulus: %d\n", a % b);      // Output: 0
    return 0;
}

[2]Relational Operators: Used to compare two values.

Code:
-----
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a = 10, b = 5;
    printf("a > b: %d\n", a > b);  // Output: 1 (true)
    printf("a < b: %d\n", a < b);  // Output: 0 (false)
    printf("a == b: %d\n", a == b); // Output: 0 (false)
    return 0;
}

[3]Conditional (Ternary) Operator: Used for conditional expressions.

Code:
-----
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    int max;

    // Using ternary operator to find the maximum
    max = (a > b) ? a : b;

    printf("The maximum value is: %d\n", max);
    return 0;
}


Q.3 (c) Program to Find Sum of First N Odd Numbers.[Example 1+3+5+7+...+N]

#include <stdio.h>

void main() 
{
    int n, sum = 0;
    printf("Enter value of N: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2) 
    {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum of first N odd numbers: %d\n", sum);
    
}//end of main fuction
