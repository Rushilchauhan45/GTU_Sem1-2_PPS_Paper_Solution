Q.2 (a) Define break and continue statement with Example.

break: Exits the current loop.
continue: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.

Example:

for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 3)
    {
         continue;
    }else
    {
        break;
    }
    printf("%d ", i);
}//end of for loop

Q.2 (b) Categorize the major components of a computer system and give their functions.

Input Devices: Provide data to the system (e.g., Keyboard, Mouse).
Processor (CPU): Processes data.
Memory (RAM/ROM): Stores data temporarily/permanently.
Output Devices: Displays results (e.g., Monitor, Printer).
