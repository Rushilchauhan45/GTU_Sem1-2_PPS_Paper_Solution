Q.4 (a) Importance of stdio.h Header File.

Provides standard input/output functions like printf, scanf, getchar.
Essential for I/O operations in C programs.

Q.4 (b) File Management in C

-->File Management in C refers to handling files for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation using functions like `fopen()`, `fclose()`, `fread()`, and `fwrite()`. It allows programs to create, read, write, and modify files efficiently. Common file modes include `r` (read), `w` (write), and `a` (append).

----------------------
File Functions:
----------------------
fopen: Open file
fclose: Close file
fprintf: Write to file
fscanf: Read from file
-----------------------

Q.4 (c) Prime Number Function
[*MMIMP][Easy also]

#include<stdio.h>

int check_prime(num) 
{
    if (num <= 1) 
    {
        return 0;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) 
    {
        if (num % i == 0) 
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    return 1;
}

int main()
{
    int num ;
    printf("Enter the Number:");
    scanf("%d",num);

    if(check_prime())
    {
        printf("%d is prime number..",num);
    }else
    {
        printf("%d is Not prime number..",num);
    }
    return num;
}

Q.4 (a) Distinguish between Structure and Union.[*IMP] 
 
Structure vs Union (3 Marks)
[Memory Allocation:]

Structure: Allocates separate memory for each member.
Union: All members share the same memory location.

[Size:]

Structure: Size is the sum of all members' sizes.
Union: Size is equal to the largest member's size.

[Access:]

Structure: All members can be accessed simultaneously.
Union: Only one member can be accessed at a time.

Q.4 (b) Develop an algorithm to print first N Fibonacci numbers. 04 

1-->Start
2-->Take input N (number of Fibonacci numbers to print).
3-->Set:
    a = 0 (First number)
    b = 1 (Second number)
4-->Print a and b.
5-->Repeat the following steps (N-2) times:
    Calculate c = a + b (Next number in the sequence).
    Print c.
    a = b and b = c.
6-->Stop

Q.4 (c) Sum, Min, and Average of an Array

#include <stdio.h>

void main() 
{
    int arr[10], sum = 0, min;
    float avg;
    printf("Enter 10 numbers:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
    {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    min = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) 
    {
        if (arr[i] < min) min = arr[i];
    }
    avg = sum / 10.0;
    printf("Sum: %d, Min: %d, Average: %.2f\n", sum, min, avg);
    
}
