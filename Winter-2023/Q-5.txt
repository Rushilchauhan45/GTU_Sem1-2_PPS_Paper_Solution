Q.5 (a)
Structure vs Union (3 Marks)
[Memory Allocation:]

Structure: Allocates separate memory for each member.
Union: All members share the same memory location.

[Size:]

Structure: Size is the sum of all members' sizes.
Union: Size is equal to the largest member's size.

Structure: All members can be accessed simultaneously.
Union: Only one member can be accessed at a time.

Q.5 (b)
File Handling Functions (4 Marks)
fopen(): Opens a file in a specified mode (e.g., read, write, append) and returns a file pointer. Syntax: FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);

fclose(): Closes an open file and frees resources associated with it. Syntax: int fclose(FILE *stream);
Example:

FILE *file = fopen("file.txt", "r");
fclose(file);

Q.5 (c)
Find Max and Min in Array (7 Marks)

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int arr[10], i, max, min;
    printf("Enter 10 numbers:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    { 
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }
    max = min = arr[0];
    for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) 
    {
        if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
        if (arr[i] < min) min = arr[i];
    }
    printf("Max: %d, Min: %d", max, min);
    return 0;
}
