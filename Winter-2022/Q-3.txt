Q.3 (a) Find Errors and Correct (3 Marks)
Original Code:

int main() {
    if (10 % 2 == 0) {
        break;
    }
}
Corrected Code:

int main() {
    if (10 % 2 == 0) {
        printf("Even Number");
    }
    return 0;
}
Error: break cannot be used outside a loop or switch.

Q.3 (b) Output of Given Code (4 Marks)
Code:

void main() {
    int a = 0;
    while (a < 10) {
        a++;
        if (a % 3 == 1)
            continue;
        printf(" %d", a);
    }
}
Output: 2 3 5 6 8 9

Q.3 (c) Program to Find Factorial (7 Marks)

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n, fact = 1;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        fact *= i;
    }
    printf("Factorial: %d", fact);
    return 0;
}

OR
Q.3 (a) Find out error(s), if any in the following code and correct it: 

int main() { 
    printf(“%f %d”, 7.0%5.0, 5 || -2); 
}

(1)Incorrect use of quotation marks: The quotation marks used in the printf function are not standard double quotes ("), but curly quotes (“”). Replace them with standard quotes.

(2)Modulo operation with floating-point numbers: The modulo operator (%) can only be used with integers, not floating-point numbers. You cannot perform 7.0 % 5.0. You need to either cast the values to integers or use another approach for floating-point modulo calculation.

(3)Logical OR operation: The expression 5 || -2 evaluates as true (since both 5 and -2 are non-zero values, which are considered true). The result is a Boolean value (1 or 0), and this part of the code is fine, but it's good practice to clarify the expected behavior in context.

Q.3 (b) Examine following code and give output of it. 

void main()
{ 
   int i=1; 
   for (i=10; i>=1 ; --i) 
   { 
        printf (“ %d”, i); 
        i--; 
   } 
}

Q.3 (C)Program to Sum Digits (7 Marks)

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n, sum = 0;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    while (n > 0) {
        sum += n % 10;
        n /= 10;
    }
    printf("Sum of digits: %d", sum);
    return 0;
}
